# SimUDuck
SimUDuck is an example for Intro to design pattern. It is based on following principle: 

Design Principle: "Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same". It loosely translates to Take what varies and “encapsulate” it so it won’t affect the rest of your code. The result? Fewer unintended consequences from code changes and more f lexibility in your systems!

Also 

Design Principle: "Program to an interface, not an implementation". That is in this example you can see the Duck behaviors will live in a separate class—a class that implements a particular behavior interface. That way, the Duck classes won’t need to know any of the implementation details for their own behaviors.
